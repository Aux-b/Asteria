# Hey!

### This is a remake of a game I worked aaaaaggggeees ago and have returned to making. I lost the original repository, so here I am making a new one. Anyway, here is some info:

# Info about Asteria

- Asteria is an open-source game made by *me*, Aux-b for reference, first coded in **Java**.

- As of the first release, the code for the game is 163 lines long

- It has a discord server, again, I made ages ago so I wouldn't be expecting much livelihood.

- Because it is the first release, It isn't packed with features however there is some game logic such as debt (One of the only ones as of now lmao)
