# Asteria ðŸŒŸ
Asteria is a fast-paced game where you play as a blue hashtag (#) zooming around a world of obstacles, all in pursuit of those delicious yellow asterisks (*). But watch out! The X-shaped obstacles aren't just sitting around forever... if you let your score drop below zero, they'll start hunting you down!

## How to Play
Control your blue hashtag (#) and gobble up those yellow asterisks (*) for points! Each asterisk you eat gives you 1 point.
Dodge the X-shaped stationary obstacles â€” unless you want to lose points!
If your score dips below zero, the game enters "debt mode": the obstacles will start teleporting toward you. Good luck surviving that chaos!
## Features
Smooth Controls: Use the arrow keys to move your hashtag around the board.
Points System: Score 1 point per asterisk you eat â€” but beware, losing points will have serious consequences!
Colorful Graphics: Enjoy the sleek, simple design of a blue hashtag vs. yellow asterisks.
Obstacles: Static X-shaped obstacles block your path... until they don't.
Console Debugging: Watch the inner workings of the game unfold in real time (if you're into that kinda thing).
Debt System: Go into negative points? Uh-oh. Those X obstacles will stop being stationary and start teleporting toward you. Youâ€™ll want to avoid that, trust me.
# Coming Soon
Teleport Power: Instantly teleport to the nearest asterisk for 3 consecutive moves. Perfect for escaping tricky situations!
Immunity Power: Need a break from all the chaos? Activate immunity and sail right through the obstacles without taking any damage. (This oneâ€™s a bit tough to implement, but hey, we're working on it!)
